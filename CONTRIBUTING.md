- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to the following style:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use arrow functions for short anonymous functions
- Use template literals for string interpolation

**Example:**

```javascript
/**
 * Generates a UUID v4 string
 * @returns {string} A valid UUID v4
 */
function generateUUID() {
    return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {
        const r = Math.random() * 16 | 0;
        const v = c === 'x' ? r : (r & 0x3 | 0x8);
        return v.toString(16);
    });
}

/**
 * UUID Generator class
 */
class UUIDGenerator {
    constructor() {
        this.generatedUUIDs = [];
        this.initializeElements();
    }
    
    /**
     * Initialize DOM elements and event listeners
     */
    initializeElements() {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

### CSS Styleguide

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use kebab-case for class names
- Use meaningful class names that describe purpose, not appearance
- Group related properties together
- Use shorthand properties when possible
- Include vendor prefixes when necessary
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for repeated values
- Keep selectors as simple as possible
- Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary

**Example:**

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #007bff;
    --secondary-color: #6c757d;
    --border-radius: 8px;
    --transition-duration: 0.3s;
}

.uuid-generator {
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 2rem;
    font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
}

.btn-primary {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    border: none;
    border-radius: var(--border-radius);
    color: white;
    cursor: pointer;
    font-size: 1rem;
    padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
    transition: background-color var(--transition-duration) ease;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
}
```

### HTML Styleguide

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper meta tags
- Use meaningful `id` and `class` attributes
- Include `alt` attributes for images

- Include ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Validate HTML using W3C validator

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Generate UUID v4 identifiers quickly and easily">
    <title>UUID Generator</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>UUID Generator</h1>
    </header>
    
    <main class="uuid-generator">

                <input 
                    type="number" 
                    id="quantity" 
                    min="1" 
                    max="10000" 
                    value="1"
                    aria-describedby="quantity-help"
                >
                <small id="quantity-help">Enter a number between 1 and 10,000</small>
            </div>
        </section>
